# Heart-Disease-Detection-Classification-Model
Heart Disease Detection Using Machine Learning Classification Algorithms in Python

As heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, the aim of this project to predict whether a person will develop heart disease, which is of paramount importance. Rather than relying on physiological data, such as the results of a stress test or electrocardiogram readings, this model will be trained on self-reported medical histories and demographic information, including BMI and race. My objective is to develop a classification model that can predict a person's risk of developing heart disease without the need for specific heart disease tests. I plan to employ various machine learning algorithms, such as K-Nearest Neighbor and Na√Øve Bayes algorithms, to determine which one works best.

By creating an accurate classification model and making it widely accessible, we can raise awareness among individuals about their risk of developing or having heart disease before receiving a formal diagnosis. This early awareness can prompt patients to seek medical evaluation and treatment from a physician. Having such a tool at our disposal has the potential to prevent thousands of deaths by increasing people's awareness of potential health risks.
